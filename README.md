Yo! Name is CJ. How are you doing? 

I like surpassing my limits and learning new things. I can be a very competitive person at times but kinda lazy at other times. If you ever get to see or meet me in real life, you'd know who I am... that sounded better in my head.

Currently learning a plethora of different skills, including, but not limited to, web development, python coding (still need to master it), CLI for Unix systems (I need to know EVERYTHING), and advanced bash scripting.

My profile will be barren for now because I'm not working on any grand projects at this moment, I just use it to store important files for easy retrieval.
